### Hi, I'm Beverley!

✈️ I'm currently a project officer at NTU and finishing up my Master of Engineering in the School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering. 

🔭 My day job mostly involves working with CFD codes and running CFD simulations.

🖥️ Outside of that, I also enjoy web design and development.
